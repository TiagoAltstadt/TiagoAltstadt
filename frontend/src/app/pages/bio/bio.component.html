            <p class="paragraph">

                My name is <b>Tiago Altstadt</b>. <br>
                And I am a <b>Full Stack Web Developer</b>. <br><br>
                From a very young age, I found myself surrounded by computers, electronic devices, and websites. In
                programming, I discovered not only my vocation but also a space where I could bring my ideas and
                emotions to life.
                <br><br>
                I am currently studying <b>Data Science and Artificial Intelligence</b>, while also working as a
                programmer and
                developing personal projects.
                <br><br>
                I believe that teamwork is the best path for professional growth. It has not only given me immense
                perspective but has also taught me a large part of what I know today.
                <br><br>
                I speak <b>Spanish</b>, <b>English</b>, and <b>Italian</b>.
                <br><br>
                I am deeply driven by curiosity and an eagerness to learn new things. I easily adapt to new environments
                and places, and I constantly work to become better.
                <br><br>
                Below, you’ll find the technologies I work with most comfortably — and if you don’t see the one you’re
                looking for, don’t worry, the phrase that best defines me is: "What I don't know, I learn."
